    <div class="glass-card">

      <p>I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Biosystems Engineering at <strong>Michigan State University</strong>, beginning in Fall 2024 under the supervision of <a href="https://www.yuzhenlu.com/">Dr. Yuzhen Lu</a>. My research focuses on developing advanced optical sensing systems and computer vision algorithms to tackle key challenges in smart agriculture, particularly in 3D perception, automated grading, and precision phenotyping.</p>

      <p>Before joining MSU, I earned my M.S. degree from <strong>Beijing Forestry University (BFU)</strong>, where I conducted research on environment perception in complex forest scenes and the automation of forestry equipment. I received my B.S. in <strong>Information and Computing Science</strong> from <strong>China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing)</strong>.</p>

      <p>Prior to my university studies, I was a professional athlete in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_direction_finding">Radio direction finding</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orienteering">Orienteering</a>. I also played football in formal training programs, and have always supported <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changchun_Yatai_F.C.">Changchun Yatai</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF">Real Madrid</a></strong>.</p>

      

      <p>In my free time, I enjoy cooking, <a href="/photography">photography</a>, and exploring new technologies. I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and am always eager to learn and grow in my field.</p>
